#UC 4 - Bring your own user pool:
A SaaS company has seperated its value into seperate value streams, all publishing their functionalities as APIs.
In order to ensure a quick onboarding of new customers (typically called tenants), there's an possibility to bring their own existing userpool. All used APIs afterwards can be authenticated agaonst using the userpool of the tenant. Usage statistics of individual users are centrally available per customer.
